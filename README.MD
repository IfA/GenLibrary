# GenLibrary

A generic base implementation of a model-based library system for *MBUID* (Model-based UI Development) that can be extended for specific UI modeling languages. It is based on the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/).

The functionality is explained in more detail in [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-39510-4_44).
